A handy reference for XIP editors and those who want to become one

## Abstract

An XDC Network Improvement Proposal (XIP) is a design document providing information to the XDC community, or describing a new feature for the XDC Network or its processes or environment. The XIP standardization process is a mechanism for proposing new features, for collecting community technical input on an issue, and for documenting the design decisions that have gone into the XDC Network. Because improvement proposals are key components of the XDC Network, it is important that they are well reviewed before reaching `Final` status. XIPs are stored in text files in a versioned repository which is monitored by the XIP editors.

This article describes the recommended process for becoming an XIP editor.


## Specification

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119).


## Application and Onboarding Process

Anyone having a good understanding of the XIP standardization and network upgrade process, intermediate level experience on the core and/or application side of the XDC Network, and willingness to contribute to the process management MAY apply to become an XIP editor. Potential XIP editors SHOULD have the following skills:
- Good communication skills
- Ability to handle contentious discourse
- 1-5 spare hours per week

The best available resource to understand the XIP process is [XIP-1](https://xips.xdc.community/XIPS/xip-1). Anyone desirous of becoming an XIP editor MUST understand this document. Afterwards, participating in the XIP process by commenting on and suggesting improvements to PRs and issues will familliarize the procedure, and is RECOMMENDED. The contributions of newer editors SHALL be monitored by other XIP editors.

Anyone meeting the above requirements MAY make a pull request adding themselves as an XIP editor and adding themselves to the editor list in [XIP-1](https://xips.xdc.community/XIPS/xip-1). If the existing XIP editors approve, the author SHALL become a full XIP editor. This SHALL notify the editor of relevant new proposals submitted in the XIPs repository, and they SHALL review and merge pull requests.

## Rationale

- "6 months" was chosen as the cutoff for denoting `Stagnant` XIPs terminally-`Stagnant` arbitrarily.
